### Timechange

#### Description

The purpose of the Timechange project is to design an open source software tool that simplifies as much as possible the task of sophisticated ML analysis of time series data. Moreover, Timechange will be unique in that it will serve as a one stop shop solution for data input, pre-processing, and transformation, as well as training and evaluation of state-of-the-art deep learning methods. The focus with regards to the design of this system during the Fall 2017 Software Engineering course, will be on the implementation of features **available on the web** that will allow the system to generate images from transformed time series data, and then to use these images to train **a RNN**, a deep learning model.

#### Usage instructions

1. Create and run a virtual environment
    - pip install virtualenv            #installs virtualenv
    - virtualenv my_project             #creates project
    - source my_project/bin/activate    #activates projects
2. pip install -r requirements.txt      #installs requirements to run app
3. run `python manage.py runserver`     #starts a server
